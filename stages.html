            <h2>About Bloom Journey</h2>
            <p class="about">The bloom phenomenon is the stage in a plant’s life cycle when buds open and flowers appear, marking the shift from growth to reproduction. It happens when conditions like light, temperature, and hormones align. Timing is crucial—if flowers bloom too early or too late, they may face frost, lack of pollinators, or shortened growing seasons, all of which reduce reproductive success. Blooming is highly useful: it enables plants to reproduce, provides food for pollinators, supports ecosystems, and benefits humans through agriculture and culture. While it doesn’t directly change the physical environment, it strongly influences ecosystems by attracting pollinators, shaping food chains, and maintaining biodiversity. In short, bloom is both a vital biological process and a driver of ecological balance.</p>

                <h3>Stage 1 - Seed Stage</h3>
                <p>A plant's life begins with its seed, which houses a tiny embryo and food that is stored in a protective covering. Until favorable circumstances like oxygen, water, and temperature are present, it stays dormant. Chemical reactions that start as soon as water is absorbed cause roots and shoots to grow. This stage is crucial because it determines whether the seed will successfully sprout into a healthy seedling. The protective coat also helps the seed survive harsh conditions until the right environment allows growth to begin. Inside the seed, stored nutrients such as starch provide the energy needed for early development, while enzymes break down these reserves into simpler forms that the embryo can use. In this way, the seed acts as both a shelter and a food supply, preparing the young plant for the challenges of germination and growth.</p>

                <h3>Stage 2 - Germination Stage</h3>
                <p>Water is absorbed by the embryo, which causes the seed coat to swell and rupture. Before the shoot grows toward the light, the root first appears to anchor the plant. When the plant starts using photosynthesis to produce energy, early buds emerge. This stage is one of the most important transitions in a plant’s life because the seed shifts from relying on stored food to making its own energy. The root system continues to grow deeper into the soil, allowing the young plant to take in more water and minerals. At the same time, the shoot grows upward, guided by light, ensuring that the new leaves can capture sunlight. Germination marks the beginning of independent growth, setting the foundation for the plant’s survival and future development.</p>

                <h3>Stage 3 - Seedling  Stage</h3>
                <p>As true leaves emerge, the plant becomes more and more dependent on photosynthesis for energy. To improve a plant's growth and environmental adaptation, its roots spread out and branch out to absorb water and nutrients. During this stage, the seedling is still fragile and highly sensitive to changes in its environment, such as light, water, and temperature. The development of strong stems and larger leaves helps the young plant support itself and capture more sunlight for energy. This is also the time when the seedling begins to establish its basic structure, forming the foundation for its future growth into a mature plant. Healthy seedlings are crucial because any weakness at this stage can affect the entire plant’s life cycle.</p>

                <h3>Stage 4 - Vegetative Growth Stage</h3>
                <p>The plant produces a lot of leaves, stems, and roots. To get ready to bloom, it stores energy as sugars. Hormones trigger the transition to reproductive stages, and the plant reacts to temperature and light. During this stage, the plant focuses on building a strong structure that can support future flowers and fruits. Leaves increase in both size and number, maximizing the surface area for photosynthesis and energy production. Roots grow deeper and wider, improving stability and allowing the plant to absorb more water and minerals from the soil. Environmental factors, such as day length and seasonal changes, play a major role in signaling when the plant is ready to move beyond vegetative growth. This stage is critical because a healthy vegetative phase ensures that the plant has enough strength and stored resources to successfully flower and reproduce.</p>

                <h3>Stage 5 - Bud Formation Stage</h3>
                <p>The plant’s shoot apex switches from leaf production to floral bud formation. The bud begins forming inside small shoots, gradually swelling as cells divide and differentiate. At this stage, the plant shifts its focus from growth to reproduction, preparing the structures that will eventually become flowers. The developing buds remain protected by specialized scales or leaves until they are strong enough to emerge. Inside, cells organize into distinct floral parts such as petals, sepals, stamens, and carpels. Environmental cues like light and temperature often play a key role in triggering this process, ensuring the buds develop at the right season. This careful transition marks the beginning of flowering and is essential for the plant’s ability to reproduce and pass on its genetic material.</p>

                <h3>Stage 6 - Bud Swelling Stage</h3>
                <p>The bud visibly swells due to cell enlargement and division, becoming more prominent under the protective scales. At this point, the bud is actively preparing for emergence, with tissues inside rapidly growing and differentiating into specialized flower parts. The protective outer scales gradually loosen, allowing the swelling bud to expand without damage. This stage is highly sensitive, as sudden changes in temperature or frost can destroy the developing bud. As it continues to enlarge, the bud signals the plant’s readiness to enter the flowering phase, moving closer to reproduction. The swelling process not only marks growth but also ensures that the inner structures are strong enough to survive once exposed to the outside environment.</p>

                <h3>Stage 7 - Partial Bud Opening Stage</h3>
                <p>The bud scales begin to separate slightly, allowing light and air to reach the bud. Green parts inside the bud gradually become visible. This stage marks the first real sign that the bud is ready to break free from its protective covering. As the bud opens, chlorophyll-rich tissues start to interact with sunlight, giving the bud its green appearance. The partial opening also allows for better gas exchange, which supports the rapid growth of inner tissues. At this point, the plant is highly sensitive to environmental stress, since the young green parts are no longer fully shielded. Partial bud opening is therefore a delicate balance between protection and exposure, signaling that the plant is on the verge of full bloom.</p>

                <h3>Stage 8 - Emergence of Green Parts Stage</h3>
                <p>Leaves or small petals emerge visibly in green through the scales, indicating clear differentiation of floral organs. At this stage, the plant is clearly shifting toward flowering, as the protective bud scales are pushed aside and young tissues are exposed to light and air. The green parts contain chlorophyll, allowing the plant to increase photosynthesis and generate more energy to support the rapid development of flowers. This stage is both exciting and risky: while growth becomes more visible, the delicate emerging parts are vulnerable to pests, diseases, or sudden weather changes. The emergence of green parts represents a critical turning point, as the plant prepares for the final stages of reproduction and the full display of its flowers.</p>

                <h3>Stage 9 - Tight Bud Stage</h3>
                <p>The bud elongates and becomes more defined, yet remains tightly closed to protect the internal floral parts. At this point, the bud is clearly visible and continues to grow in size, but the protective outer layers keep the delicate floral organs safe from damage. Inside, rapid cell division and differentiation are shaping the final structure of petals, stamens, and other floral parts. The tight bud acts like a shield, ensuring that no premature exposure to light, pests, or harsh weather harms the developing flower. This stage is critical, because any injury or stress here can directly affect the quality, shape, or even survival of the flower once it blooms.</p>

                <h3>Stage 10 - Initial Flower Opening Stage</h3>
                <p>Petals slowly begin to separate from each other; the bud starts to open but the flower is not fully open yet. At this stage, the flower begins to reveal its inner structures, though they are still partly hidden and protected. The gradual unfolding allows the plant to test environmental conditions—such as temperature, humidity, and light—before committing to a full bloom. This careful process also helps protect the reproductive organs from sudden damage. Pollinators may start to notice the flower at this point, but most cannot access it fully until the petals spread wider. The initial opening marks a delicate transition between protection and exposure, preparing the flower for its final display and reproductive role.</p>

                <h3>Stage 11 - Full Bloom (Anthesis) Stage</h3>
                <p>The flower fully opens, exposing reproductive organs like stamens and stigma, ready for pollination. The flower may attract pollinators through scent or nectar. At this stage, the plant achieves its main reproductive goal, displaying vibrant colors, fragrances, and patterns to draw in insects, birds, or other pollinators. The petals are spread wide to provide easy access, while nectar guides and ultraviolet markings invisible to humans help direct pollinators to the right spot. This stage is often short-lived but extremely important, as successful pollination during anthesis determines whether seeds and fruits will develop. Full bloom also represents the peak of the plant’s life cycle in terms of beauty and ecological interaction.</p>

                <h3>Stage 12 - Post-Flowering (Senescence) Stage</h3>
                <p>Flowers wilt after pollination or if pollination fails; petals fall off as nutrients are redirected to fruit and seed development. During this stage, the flower’s role is complete, and the plant conserves its energy for the next generation. The fading petals and drooping structures are outward signs of programmed cell death, a natural process known as senescence. While the flower withers, important activity continues inside the plant: fertilized ovules begin developing into seeds, and the surrounding tissues may grow into fruit to protect and disperse them. If pollination did not occur, the flower still shuts down to save resources, ensuring the plant directs its strength toward survival rather than wasted effort. This stage highlights the cycle of renewal, where the end of one part of the plant’s life fuels the beginning of another.</p>
